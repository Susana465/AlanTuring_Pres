Draft LaTeX definitions to replicate Turing poster style (portrait)

# Use

Modify `turing-poster.tex` to include your content. Note that you have to put
the first section header before the code for the image. (I'm working on it.)

LaTeX as normal. Document will be A4: ask the printer to print A1 (or whatever).

# Notes

- The document is a complete LaTeX document, not a package. All formatting is
  done in the preamble.

- It is based on the article class, not beamer.

- It is designed at A4; and it is intended that you simply scale to A1 for
  posters.

- Many things (like subsection headers) have not been styled correctly.

# Differences from the Turing format

- Body font size is 12pt (at A4-equivalent) rather than 14pt

- Font is Helvetica rather than Arial
